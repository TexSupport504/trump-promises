## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Test the Application
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd C:\Users\chris\trump-promises

# Run the Flask server
python app.py
# OR
python -m flask --app app.py run --debug
```

### 2. View the Theme Preview
Open `preview-dark-theme.html` in your browser to see the dark mode design in action.

### 3. Use Figma for Design
1. Create a new Figma file
2. Import the color palette from `DESIGN-GUIDE.md`
3. Use Figma's text-to-code AI with these prompts:

**Navigation Bar Prompt:**
```
Create a dark navigation bar with background #1a1a1a, white text (#ffffff), rounded corners, and subtle shadow. Include logo with flag icon, navigation menu items, and search bar. Add hover effects with slight upward movement.
```

**Promise Card Prompt:**
```
Design a dark card component with background #1a1a1a, white text (#ffffff), 12px border radius, and box shadow. Include header with category icon, main content area with title and description, and footer with status badge. Add white gradient line at top.
```

**Dashboard Card Prompt:**
```
Create a dashboard stat card with black background (#1a1a1a), large white number, icon, and label. Add hover effect with upward movement and enhanced shadow. Make it clean and minimal.
```

## 🎯 Design Principles Implemented

### High Contrast
- Pure black backgrounds with white text
- 4.5:1+ contrast ratios for accessibility
- Strategic use of gray tones for hierarchy

### Minimal Aesthetics
- Clean, uncluttered interface
- Subtle animations and hover effects
- Focus on content over decoration

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Flexible layouts with CSS Grid/Flexbox
- Scalable typography and spacing

## 🔧 Figma Workflow

### Design System Setup
1. **Colors**: Import the exact hex codes from our palette
2. **Typography**: Use Inter font family with defined weights
3. **Components**: Create reusable cards, buttons, and navigation
4. **Styles**: Set up consistent spacing and shadows

### AI Prompts Best Practices
- Always specify exact hex colors
- Include hover states and animations
- Mention accessibility requirements
- Define specific spacing values (12px, 16px, 24px)

### Code Export
- Export CSS and convert to our variable system
- Ensure responsive design patterns
- Test across different screen sizes
- Validate accessibility compliance
